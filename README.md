## Description

This module provides the exec task. This task allows you to run an arbitary command with arguments.

## Requirements
This module is compatible with Puppet Enterprise and Puppet Bolt.

* To run tasks with Puppet Enterprise, PE 2018.1 or later must be installed on the machine from which you are running task commands. Machines receiving task requests must be Puppet agents.

* To run tasks with Puppet Bolt, Bolt 1.0 or later must be installed on the machine from which you are running task commands. Machines receiving task requests must have SSH or WinRM services enabled.

## Usage

To run an exec task, use the task command, specifying the command to be executed.

* With PE on the command line, run `puppet task run exec command=<COMMAND>`.
* With Bolt on the command line, run `bolt task run exec command=<COMMAND>`.

For example, to view the free disk space of a host, run:

* With PE, run `puppet task run exec command="df -h" --nodes neptune`.
* With Bolt, run `bolt task run exec command="df -h" --nodes neptune --modulepath ~/modules`.

This example is specifically for Windows using Powershell and returns a list of features installed on the server:
`puppet task run exec command='powershell -command "Get-WindowsFeature  | Where Installed | Format-List -Property Name"' --nodes neptune`

* For exec::windows task, CLI provider can also be passed using the 'provider' parameter. Supported CLIs are cmd and powershell, with default being cmd.
`puppet task run exec provider=powershell command="Get-WindowsFeature  | Where Installed | Format-List -Property Name" --nodes neptune`

You can also run tasks in the PE console. See PE task documentation for complete information.
